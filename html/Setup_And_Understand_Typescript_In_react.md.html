<p>I'm someone who likes to understand what I'm doing from the ground up. When I initally started using typescript I needed for my job and I just need to write code to get features done. One thing I didn't do was try and understand it from first principles. In this post we'll explore typescript from first priciples. What does that mean? For the sake of this article it means</p>
<ol>
<li>how to set up typescript on it's own.</li>
<li>How to meaningfully integrate ts into a React project.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's get started!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For the rest of the article I'll refer to typescript as ts</p>

<h2 id="typescriptconfig">Typescript config</h2>
<p>Lets setup our project a bit. Create a dir, make index.ts file, init that dir as a yarn project, get ts as a dep</p>
<p>Ts is like any other node/yarn package. You can download it with</p>
<pre><code class="yarn language-yarn">yarn add -D typescript
</code></pre>
<p>Cool now we have the ts compiler. Now we can write some basic TS in <code>index.ts</code></p>
<pre><code class="typescript language-typescript">function getHelloWorld(): string {
  return "Hello, World";
}

function main(): void {
  let helloWorld = getHelloWorld();
  console.log(helloWorld);
}
main();
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">Hello, World
</code></pre>
<p>So we</p>
<ol>
<li>downloaded the compiler</li>
<li>used it to produce a .js file</li>
<li>ran the file</li>
</ol>
<p>Awesome! You can figure this out from the ts landing page, but one thing that isn't as easy to get and understand initally (at least it wasn't for me) is config. <code>tsconfig.json</code> functions a lot like <code>package.json</code>. It signifies the root of the typescript project allows for configuration of it.</p>
<p>â€¦There are a lot of config options we don't have time to go over all of them, but I recommend taking a look at</p>

<h3 id="howtoconfigureforareactproject">How to configure for a React Project</h3>
<p>So now we've played with typescript a bit and understand <code>tsconfig</code>. If you've ever set up a React project from scratch it's actually the same thing. The only thing that you need to do is add a a loader for TS files and create a config file for TS to tell it that you'll be using typed react.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: show webpack config where you link the tsconfig file</p>
<p><strong>pitfalls</strong>: if you use vscode and you use a different file other than <code>tsconfig.json</code>, vscode still tries to use <code>tsconfig.json</code></p>
<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>
<p>I think why webpack can be so confusing to beginners is because what it does in a react app isn't explained simpily enough. For the most part webpack reads a file does certain processe on it (loaders, etc) then produces new files. TS pretty much does the samething. It reads a file and produces a new file.</p></body></html>
