  <body><h1 id="whyidecidedtostopworkingonmyproject">Why I Decided To Stop Working On My Project</h1>
<p>Date: May 26th 2020</p>
<p>I've decided to stop working on streetwear.dating a dating site for the streetwear community. Why? Well first of all I started it out of panic. I recently quit my job, and I'm without an income. I'd be lying if said that I wasn't a bit freaked out by that. I thought that I could start any business with a viable market out of the blue and turn it into a success. I was wrong. Why? When it came to recruiting users for streetwear.dating it didn't feel <em>right</em>. I like streetwear, but I don't consider myself as part of that community. I don't have any interest in helping people date. I didn't intend on using the site myself. I wasn't comfortable selling a dating site and that lead to lack of conviction. In the end I wasn't comfortable talking to users about a streetwear dating site.</p>
<p>I still managed to convince myself this was a good idea though. Starting out I thought dating apps have market validation, and it was just a matter of validating that the streetwear community would want a dating site. <strong>Turns out if your not actually interested in something it's a horrible idea to try and create that business from it</strong> (I'm sure many people could have told me this, but I'm someone who doesn't learn until they actually do something). I still believe that there is a market for this, and people would use it, but I won't be the one to do it. If your interested in pursuing this feel free to contact me.</p>
<h2 id="otherfailures">Other Failures</h2>
<p>Switching gears a bit I want to talk about other projects I have pursued that failed. I created a Journaling website called <a href="https://journful.com">journful.com</a>, and a what did you wear today site (WDYWT) <a href="https://the-wdywt.com">the-wdywt.com</a>. I was able to create these sites pretty quickly as they weren't overly complex, and I believed they could be productized. Again, when it came to recruitting users I completely failed and rightly so. In the case of Journful I'm actually someone who journals, and maybe could have recruited some users, <strong>but I never actually attempted to get users. I killed it by self doubt and inaction before getting there</strong>. Also, I didn't end up using it myself, which was the original intention. In the case of the-wdywt I had no conviction, and it wasn't even something I inteded to use myself!? The-wdywt reasons for failue are almost identical to streetwear.dating. Not part of the community, not interested in using it, no conviction in selling it, etc.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://journful.com">Journful</a>, <a href="https://streetwear.dating">streetwear.dating</a>, and <a href="https://the-wdywt.com">the-wdywt.com</a> are all failures. Streetwear.dating &amp; the-wdywt.com are dead to me now and for the forseable future. I still believe Journful has potential.</p>
<p>So what did I learn from this? I think I learned the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I'm pursuing an idea I don't geniuenly believe and care in I should think twice about pursuing it.</li>
<li>Can I really see myself talking to people about this with conviction and belief?</li>
<li>Is this something I can feel good about making and selling?</li>
<li>Is this aligned with who I am?</li>
</ol>
<p>The takeaway from these projects is <strong>if I don't believe and care about the idea + feel good selling the idea to people I shouldn't pursue it.</strong></p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next?</h2>
<p>Well it's back to the drawing board for me. The next step for me is thinking of an idea I believe and care about. After that I plan on validating it. When I think of it I'll make another post to document it!</p>
<p>Until next time,
Cheers</p>
