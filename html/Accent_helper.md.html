  <body><h1 id="accenthelper">Accent Helper</h1>
<p>Date: May 28th 2020</p>
<p>In my previous post I said I'd talk about my next venture. I came up with an idea I believe and care about. My latest venture is Accent Helper. I'm just going to call it that for now, because I don't actually have a good name for it.</p>
<p><strong>What is accent helper?</strong>: <em>accent helper is a self driven solution to help intermediate English speakers master English on their own schedule with the help of native speakers.</em></p>
<p>To help analyze it further I'm thinking about it from 3 perspectives</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the Problem</li>
<li>What are the hypotheses (in this context it means some claims that can be verified through testing)</li>
<li>Who is the Market</li>
<li>What is the solution</li>
</ol>
<p>Framing in this context helps me analyze what the product is and where I need to centralize my efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Some English learners who aren't experienced enough in the language don't know their blind spots. That is they don't know what they are doing wrong grammatically and syntactically, and from pronunciation and writing standpoints. In some of these cases you only know when you receive feedback from someone experienced enough to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>Hypotheses:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>People will use a self-driven async solution for learning English</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Market:</strong> English learners. In particular people who already have a baseline to ok understanding of English. The goal here isn't to get them from 0 to 1 with English it's to get them to native level of speaking (accent not included in this).</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Give people</p>
<ul>
<li>phrases</li>
<li>conversational questions</li>
<li>writing prompts with questions (essay other formats)</li>
<li>etc. other exercises</li>
</ul>
<p>and have experienced English speakers (native or non-native) give feedback to people learning the language.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That's the idea. Now it's my job to figure out if my hypotheses are right or wrong and why.</p></body></html>
