For accent helper I've been trying to recruit users so I can get people using the spreadsheet.

## First Usage

Someone just answered some questions, but the answers aren't what I expected. I was expecting long form answers. I got much shorter answers. Also, I was expecting them to either do a written entry or a voice entry, but they decided to do both.

# My Perspective

- First of all giving feedback in a spreadsheet isn't ideal. It would be better suited for another format. Also, I think people will likely want to have a discourse about why thing they said is wrong and why.

- It seems that people want to chat in person.
