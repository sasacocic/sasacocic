<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>A bit of context before we jump in. I recently quit my job, and I've dedicated myself full time to create a product that will be able to generate me an income. Alright cool lets jump in!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This post is about my current venture, my goals assocaited with it and how it's going.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="whatiknowandmyphilosophy">What I know and my philosophy</h3>
<p>Like I said I'm trying to create a prodcut that I can work on full time to sustain me. A lot of my thougts and philosophy about how to do this is derived from what I've heard from others. I've been heavily influenced by the internet and am basing most of my knowledge from what I've read from Y Combinator, Indie Hackers, Hacker News, or other people I like e.g. Pieter Levels, Paul Grahm, and Patrick McKenzie. My approach is do things quickly, and if they don't work out move the fuck on.</p>
<h3 id="mylatestventureandwhereimatandsomestuffibelievehowishouldgoaboutit">My latest venture and where I'm at and some stuff I believe how I should go about it</h3>
<p>My current project is <a href="https://streetwear.dating">streetwear.dating</a> a dating site for the streetwear community / hypebeasts. This idea was heavily inspired from two sources. The first is <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/013-patrick-mckenzie-of-appointment-reminder">E.13 of the indie hackers podcast w/ Patrick McKenzie</a>. In particular this quoute from Patrick</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yep, the vast majority of companies who are out there sell something that some other company has sold before. Like think of your dentist. Have you happily paid your dentist money? Yes. Did he invent dentistry? No. There's thousands and thousands of dentists out there. Your dentist makes quite a good living doing what every other dentist does. At the scale that most people in Indie Hackers are operating on, where \$2,000 a month or \$20,000 a month is life-changing to you, you do not have to be the only person executing on your business in the world to pull \$20,000 out of the economy. The economy is massive. If you're selling to businesses, you're selling to the economic engine of that economy. They have more money than you can even conceive of. It is easily possible for 100 people to occupy different parts of the backup ecosystem and all make great, great businesses out of that. Even for bingo cards to elementary school teachers, which is a terrible market in a lot of ways. Oh, I could go for an hour on that question. There were probably six firms that were bigger than mine. People only know about Bingo Card Creator because I have a big mouth about it, but yep, there's somebody in Texas who is just happily grinding it out every day and making mid six figures from that. And good on them, right?</p>

<p>(I didn't take his advice on selling to business. Yet.)</p>
<p>This really stuck with me because up to this point I had blindlessly bought into the narritive of having to create an original, never before done software business. Most likely through reading Hacker News, YC, etc. I just want ot sustain myself though. The big takeaway for me here was I could create a competitive product and be able to live off of it.</p>
<p>The second was a conversation that I had with my friend Erik , about that exact quote. I don't remember the exact conversation, but it was something along the lines of "what is an easy product that I could make to compete with something?" and the answer was a dating app. After that I knew that I needed a niche to tackle that dating apps weren't doing a good job of getting at. I setteled on the streetwear community, because of another project I had worked on <a href="https://the-wdywt.com">the-wdywt.com</a> (a what did you wear today website also targeted at the streetwear community).</p>
<p>At this point I had an idea. I knew that the next step I had to do was get some validation from the streetwear community. I need to know that they even give a shit about such a product.</p>
<p>How did I decide that I need to know weither or not people give a shit about this thing? I'm taking the adive of other people specifically (people I take a lot of inspiration from) Peter levels and Paul Grahm. Peter Levels made NomadList and well Paul Grahm started YC. (if you don't know here is some <a href="context">context</a> if your interested). One of the things that I heard from Pieter was to not waste a bunch of time on project (if it's making you money different story). Also, I've heard things from Paul Grahm about talking to customers, and making sure your building stuff that people actually want.</p>
<p><strong>Where am I at? I'm tyring to figure out if anyone gives a shit about a streetwear dating app</strong></p>
<h3 id="whatimdoingandwhathashappen">What I'm doing and what has happen</h3>
<p>Great. I have an Idea, but what's my plan? I'm going to build a landing page and see if I can get some tracktion for a streetwear dating app. Simple.</p>
<p>The current state is that I've built the landing page and now I'm trying to get those initial users. This is where I'm really struggling, but if I back up a bit</p>
<p>I go create a landing page, and then deploye that it. Boom landing page up. Alright, now I need to get some traction for my idea. Quick tangent I read <a href="https://thekanyestory.com/">The Kanye Story by Harry Dry</a>, which is awesome btw and I recommend reading it. In The Kanye Story Harry creates a Kanye West dating app and does an amazing job promoting it. I think that the situtation is similar so I try to copy what Harry has done. It worked for him so why wouldn't it work for me? Harry essentailly follows this path in the story</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a reddit post. His reddit post is really well recieved.</li>
<li>Email journalists and bloggers telling them about what he's building and his reddit post. Hist reddit post gives him good credibility.</li>
<li>From here his idea is getting a lot of attention.</li>
</ol>
<p>(btw I think this was genius on his part) So I begin. I create a reddit post on r/streetwear titled <code>streetwear.dating | dating site for streetwear enthusiasts &amp; hypebeasts coming soon!</code>. But there's a twist! I posted to Reddit and no one gave a shit. I'm shocked, dismayed and my strategy for promotion is derailed, but I should know better.</p>
<p>So I decide I'm going to take the parts of Harrys plan that I can. Since Reddit didn't work I turn to Discord, Instagram, Twitter, and Forums I can find online.</p>
<p>First I create a business Instagram account. My thinking here is I can link my site in my bio and then I can go follow a bunch of people to go view my account. I do the same thing on Twitter and have the same strategy there. I start doing this. I quickly realize Instagram and Twitter only let you follow so many people in a certain period of time. So I do this for as long as I can then come back to it.</p>
<p>I don't just want to rely on Instagram and Twitter though as they are prettu manual processes. I decide to look for forums to join and try to showcase my idea. I find a forum called Styleforum and sign up. Then I post in the <code>Streetwear and Demin</code> section. Again I make a similarly named post <code>streetwear.dating - dating site for the streetwear community coming soon!</code>. Ok I'm getting somewhere now I think. Ok what about bloggers and journalists?</p>
<p>I start collecting the names of journalists and bloggers related to streetwear brands, forums, and websites. I find some people writting articles on these sites and find there emails or social media accounts. I get about 7 people. I only end up messaging 3 of them on Twitter or Instagram with the message "I'm working on a streetwaear dating website coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions".</p>
<p>Now I'm off to discord. I know internet communites tend to huddle there and it's a bit similar to Reddit altough a different format. I start searching for streetwear discords and come accross some I like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Streetwear Notify</li>
<li>fabrics and fitpics</li>
</ul>
<p>They have a few hundered to a thousand users and about a few hundered online. This could be a great place for me to find a few users. I post in the general chats saying "Hey I'm making a dating site for hypebeast and the streetwear community (https://streetwear.dating). DMs open. Any questions or feedback is welcome.".</p>
<p>Alright I've made some headway?! I decide to sit back for a bit and see if I get anything in return.</p>
<p>How did it end up? At the time of writting I haven't heard from any of the bloggers/journalists I messaged. I got 1 response on the Styleforum forum saying "Oh Boy". After that response my post was taken down and I was banned. On Streetwear Notify I got a few reactions, but no signups. On Fabrics and fitpics I didn't get any reaction. My message was later deleted on Streetwear Notify. On Instagram and Twitter I got some followers on my accounts, but the follow people strategy hasn't worked, because I'm still at 0 signups.</p>
<p>Well it seems that no one cares, but I'm not ready to give up just yet and **I don't think I've really put in enough work to say that no one cares. I do feel a bit detered at this point, but hey no said this was going to be easy.</p>
<p>After my attempts no one has signed up for <a href="https://streetwear.dating">streetwear.dating</a>, which is a bit discouraging saying it out loud, but hey that's the nature of things.</p>
<p>So what am I going to do now? Well I'm not giving up. I think there is something here worth pursuing so I'm going to spend more time on it, and set some goals in this post to keep me honest. Hopefully it'll be a driving force for me and help get my first sign up. Also, knowing when to call it quits is important so I'll also set a date for which I'll stop working on this. If I can't get the signups.</p>
<p>Also, I have Pateron. If you want to support me it's !add patreon link here!. I'll continue to document my journey and let you great people know.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>How I got these goals? I asked what is important to me currently?</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting users. How many users? If 20 number of users don't sign up then I won't continue working on this.</li>
<li>Time. Also, I'm working on this full time there isn't anything else I'm doing. How much more time am I willing to spend trying to get people to use this? I'm will to spend 2 more weeks full time on getting users to sign up.</li>
<li>Organic growth. Organic growth is extremely important to me. I don't want fake growth to prop up something that I work on because I don't think I'll actually be able to monetize it without real users and real people who actually want to use <a href="https://streetwear.dating">streetwear.dating</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Cool. I only care about organic growth, users, and time currently.</p>
<p>Today: May 24th 2020
End Date: May 31st 2020</p>
<p>Users: 20 organic signups</p>
<h2 id="updates">Updates:</h2>
<p>Since posting this I've gotten advice from some people. Some advice I've gotten is to talk to people in person so I'm going to start doing that.</p>
<h2 id="otherrandomthougts">Other random thougts</h2>
<p>What would be awesome? 1000 users. If I could get 1000 users that would be insane.</p></body></html>
