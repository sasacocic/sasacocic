# Why I Decided To Stop Working On My Project

Date: May 26th 2020

I've decided to stop working on streetwear.dating my current venture. Why? Well first of all I started it out of panic. I recently quit my job and I'm without an income, and I'd be lying if said that I wasn't a bit freaked out by not having an income. I thought that I could start any business with a viable market out of the blue and turn it into a success. I was wrong. Why? Well because when it came to recruiting people to streetwear.dating it didn't feel _Right_. I like streetwear, but I don't consider myself as part of that community. I also just wasn't comfortable getting users for a dating site. I wasn't really comfortable with it because I don't think I really believed it and I didn't have any conviction in the idea, even though in my mind dating apps have market validation, and it was just a matter of validating that the streetwear community would want something like this. I still believe that there is a market for this and people would use it, but I won't be the one to do it, well because for the reasons I just listed.

Switching gears a bit I want to talk about the other things that I have done that have failed. I created a Journaling website called [journful.com](https://journful.com), and a what did you wear today site (WDYWT) [the-wdywt.com](https://the-wdywt.com). Both of which I have failed at. I was able to create the sites pretty quickly as I have a good amount of programming experience, but when it came to recruitting users I completely failed and rightly so. In the case of Journful I actually consider myself someone who journals, and maybe could have gotten users, **but I never actually attempted to get users. I killed it by self doubt before getting there**. I also didn't use it myself, which was I originally intended. In the case of the-wdywt I had no conviction, and it wasn't even something I inteded to use myself!? Also, a lot of the same reasons as streetwear.dating, because again it was targeted at the streetwear community, and I just don't see myself as part of that community.

I think [Journful](https://journful.com), [streetwear.dating](https://streetwear.dating), and [the-wdywt.com](https://the-wdywt.com) are all failures. Streetwear.dating & the-wdywt.com are dead to me now and for the forseable future. I still think Journful has potential for me personally. So what did I learn from this? I think I learned the following:

1. If I'm pursuing an idea I don't geniuenly believe and care in I should think twice about pursuing it.
1. Can I really see myself talking to people about this with conviction and belief?
1. Is this something I can feel good about making and selling?
1. Is this aligned with who I am?

The takeaway from these projects is **if I don't have belief in the idea and belief in me selling the idea to people I shouldn't pursue it.**

## What's next?

Well it's back to the drawing board for me. The next step for me is thinking of an idea then validating it. When I think of it I'll make another post to document it!

Until next time,
Cheers
