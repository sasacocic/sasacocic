# Why I Decided To Stop Working On My Project

Date: May 26th 2020

I've decided to stop working on streetwear.dating my current venture. Why? Well first of all I started it out of panic. I recently quit my job and I'm without an income, and I'd be lying if said that I wasn't a bit freaked out by not having an income. I thought that I could start any business with a viable market out of the blue and turn it into a success. I was wrong. Why? Well because when it came to recruiting people to streetwear.dating it didn't feel _Right_. I like streetwear, but I don't consider myself as part of that community. I also just wasn't comfortable getting users for a dating site. I wasn't really comfortable with it because I don't think I really believed it and I didn't have any conviction in the idea, even though in my mind dating apps have market validation, and it was just a matter of validating that the streetwear community would want something like this. I still believe that there is a market for this and people would use it, but I won't be the one to do it, well because for the reasons I just listed.

Switching gears a bit I want to talk about the other things that I have done that have failed. I created a Journaling website called [journful.com](https://journful.com), and a what did you wear today site (WDYWT) [the-wdywt.com](https://the-wdywt.com). Both of which I have failed at. I was able to create the sites pretty quickly as I have a good amount of programming experience, but when it came to getting users and getting people to use it I completely failed and rightly so. In the case of Journful I actually consider myself someone who journals and maybe could have got people to use it **but I never actually attempted to get users I killed it by self doubt before I got there**. I also didn't use it myself, which I intended to do because I thought I needed something like it to do my stream of consious journaling. In the case of the-wdywt I had no conviction, and my mentality was that of a mercenary i.e. ready to sell all my morals and values in the pursuit of profit, just because I didn't have an income. Also, a lot of the same reasons as streetwear.dating, because again it was the streetwear community and I just don't see myself as a streetwear person even though I do like the clothing.

I'm not ready to call Journful a failure yet, but [streetwear.dating](https://streetwear.dating), & [the-wdywt.com](https://the-wdywt.com) are dead to me currently and for the forseable future. So what did I learn from this? Well I think there is a lot to learn from both of these. Firstly is if I'm pursuing an idea I don't geniuenly believe and care in I should definetly think twice about pursuing it. I should think

1. Can I really see myself talking to people about this with conviction and belief?
1. Does this make me fell like I'm selling my morals or values in the pursuit of profit?

Well actually it seems the only takeaway from these projects is that if I don't have belief in the idea and belief in me selling the idea to people I shouldn't pursue it.

## What's next?

Well it's back to the drawing board for me. I need to find an idea I believe in and that will have conviction in selling.

Until next time,
Cheers
