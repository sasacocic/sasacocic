      Start Developing Locally - Learn Programming for complete beginners üìà
    </h1>
    <p>
      So you just finished your first coding course on codecademy or you‚Äôve been
      using an online ide like repl.it. Now you're wondering how do I actually
      do this on my own computer? Well I‚Äôll cover that in this article. In this
      article I‚Äôm going to use node js (javascript) and show you how to get up
      and running and explain what‚Äôs going on.
    </p>
    <h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>decide on title</li>
      <li>add my tiwtter handle</li>
      <li>think of more articles to branch off of from here</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <p>other possible titles</p>
    <ul>
      <li>get your code academy editor setup locally</li>
      <li>basics of setting up an enviornment and tools you need</li>
      <li>
        so you learned to code from code academy but have no idea what to do
        locally
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="addmytwittersasacocic">add my twitter @sasacocic</h2>
    <h1 id="hereswhatsonthemenu">Heres what‚Äôs on the menu</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Install node js and talk about what‚Äôs going on</li>
      <li>
        Talk about text editors and how you get some sweet functionality on your
        local machine + all the tools they come with to help you develop.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="theshortofit">The short of it üëè</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open a shell (wtf is a shell)</li>
      <li>
        Use your compiler or interpreter (wtf is a compiler or interpreter) and
        pass in a file as an argument (whaaaaat)
      </li>
      <li>
        Boom, you're up and running. A hello world program should be good to go
      </li>
      <li>
        Now you can do the most atomic step of starting a program. This is good,
        but you can do a lot better! Knowing how this works is an indispensable
        tool. To supercharge your development you‚Äôll want a good text editor or
        IDE (text editors these days really blur the lines between ide and text
        editor) this is what‚Äôll give you syntax highlighting, autocompletion,
        and a bunch of other cool features.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="thelongofit">The long of it üòæ</h2>
    <p>
      Ok the short of it really wasn‚Äôt that helpful at all. So lets dig into
      these things so you know what‚Äôs going on! Alright lets install node, but
      wait wtf is node.
    </p>
    <h4 id="detourtojavascriptland">Detour to javascript land üò•</h4>
    <p>
      Welcome to Javascript land. Just like all programming langauges Javascript
      needs to be transformed from the text we see on the screen into binary
      (what our roboto overlords understand i.e. 0's &amp; 1's). Browsers like
      Firefox and Google know how to do this. Specifically Google Chrome's
      engine for doing this is called V8. V8 looks at javascript code and turns
      it into something a computer can understand. BOOM Binary. Now some smart
      people said lets take V8 and lets build a library to interact with your OS
      and make that into a program (There is more to it, but I think for the
      most part that's it). That's node V8 plus a library that lets you do
      things with your OS that V8 didn't support. Node JS is very similar to
      your browser in the sense that it's just something that takes javascript
      code and runs it.
    </p>
    <h4 id="downloadingnodejs">Downloading Node JS üò§</h4>
    <p>
      If you go to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node js's website</a> you
      can download Node from there. Go ahead and download the one that says LTS
      (LTS stands for long term support). Follow those instructions and it
      should be pretty straight forward. If it isn't let me know and I will add
      instructions to this article.
    </p>
    <h4 id="usingnode">Using Node ü§î</h4>
    <p>
      Alright cool now we have Node installed on our machine. Lets write a hello
      world program! Copy the code below and put it in a file called
      <code>index.js</code>
    </p>
    <pre><code class="node language-node">function main() {
  console.log("hello world!");
}
main();
</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you haven't opened up your shell you'll want to do that now. I'm on a
      Mac so I'll open the <code>Terminal</code> program. If your on linux it
      should be pretty similar. If your on window I'm sorry.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Jk windows users, but I have no idea how to do this in windows. If
        someone can give me some instructions on this I'll add them here
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      some stuff on terminal basics here like <code>pwd</code> <code>ls</code>
      <code>cd</code> <code>echo</code> <code>path</code>
    </p>
    <p>run the following in the terminal</p>
    <pre><code class="bash language-bash">-&gt; node index.js
</code></pre>
    <p>you should see</p>
    <pre><code class="bash language-bash">hello world!
</code></pre>
    <p>
      explain what is up if node doesn't work for some reason. Also do a sanity
      check of why node might not be showing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's the most atomic unit of running code on your local machine. This
      process pretty much the same for all languages. When you click that green
      play button in your nice IDE or text editor this is most likely what is
      happening behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <h2 id="texteditorworld">Text Editor World ü§©</h2>
    <p>
      Lets talk about cool tools now. For the follow I'm going to use the word
      Text Editor and IDE interchangably. Also, I'm going use TE for Text
      Editor. Text Editors give us a bunch of tools + configuration to
      supercharge our development and make things easier for us. Many give
      syntax hightlighting when you've written something wrong in your code,
      autocompletion, easy code searching, visual git support, a file explorer,
      integrated shell, and much more + the ability to download 3rd party
      packages to extend the original capabilites of the text editor soooooo
      basically unlimited customization. For this article we are going to use
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. Go ahead
      and download it. Again should be pretty straight forward.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        If downloading visual studio code is not straight forward let me know
        and I can ammend this article.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="visualstudiocode">Visual Studio Code üòé</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I'm going to refer to Visual Sudio Code as VS Code going forward</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Visual Studio code has amazing support for javascript out of the box so
      there isn't really anything that we need to do for Node. Go ahead and open
      our <code>index.js</code> file in VS Code.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>!! explain how to open in vs code !!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Alright at this point we have paralleled anything in CodeAcademy or
      Repl.it. You should be ready to code to your hearts content at this point!
    </p>
    <h3 id="whatifididntlearnnodejs">What if I didn't learn Node js</h3>
    <p>
      well if you didn't learn Node js don't fret friend! VS Code has a whole
      bunch of plugins you can get. There's some for you language of choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learned Java? there's an extension (but if ) Learned Python? There's an
      extension Learned Go? There's an extension You get the picture.
    </p>
    <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      what to do next? Keep programming commrade! Enjoy the fruits of your
      labor. One thing this article didn't go over was package managers. I'll
      cover those in my next article and I'll continue with the node theme,
      we'll be using Yarn and NPM.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always I'm not perfect and I'd love feedback on this article and
      suggestions for what to talk about next. Let me know!
    </p>
    <p>Peace!</p>
