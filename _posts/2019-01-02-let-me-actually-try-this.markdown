# Bloging what?? ü§∑‚Äç 
Blog post numero uno. So I'm going to try and start blogging. This is definetly an expriement.  Most likely no one will read this, and it will be a horrible post. On the off chance that someone stumbles apon this welcome to my horrible blog! But hey you gotta start somewhere right. So in this blog I'll just cover what I'll be talking about in future blog posts and kinda my motivations for blogging. Lets start I guess? (Also emojis. High levels of emoji use might be present.)


# But what will I be blogging about? ü§´
I'll be blogging about whatever. That being said I'll probably be blogging about tech. related things as i'm a software engineer, but anything will go. This includes but is not limited to music, biking, exercising, aspirations, failures, and life. Ya anyways I'll be writing a bunch of random stuff that is hopefully really cool and interesting üòé

# Motivations
I've gotta come clean. I partially started blogging to mess around with jekyll and github (the free hosting thooo). Also, I wanted to see if there was any pains in doing so. I wanted to see what it was like to write a blog post and if it was any trouble. Truth be told (so far) the basics haven't given me any issue. I haven't done a whole lot though. I haven't messed around with anything aside from emojis (and it's kinda annoying I have use keyboard button in the top right of my mac). I'll be exploring this more so at least like 2 more blog posts? If I like it I'll keep going üòÅ (do you put periods at the end of emojis idk). Anyways thanks for reading!
